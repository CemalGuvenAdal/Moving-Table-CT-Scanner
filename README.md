# Moving-Table-CT-Scanner
This project focuses on implementing moving table CT scanner and reconstructing images 
using projections from slices as accurate as possible. Lung and brain datasets are used in order 
to show the simulation. Radon and inverse radon transforms are used with projections from 
different slices in order to reconstruct images. Matlab is used for the implementation of the 
project. Datasets are loaded within Sample Data add on in matlab. Dynamic processing 
algorithms are used for reconstruction of the image. With the algorithm that is implemented 
and discussed in the report accurate reconstruction of the given datasets were established with 
high accuracy.
